# PythonQStation
This is a small python script with a GUI to control your Q Station and Bulbs. At the moment it is possible to find the Q Station and detect the connected Bulbs.

I will add a detailed description and comments to the python code later on.

Instructions for running the app:

1. Run main.py to pull up the UI for the Q Station Controller.
2. Enter the IP Address of your Q Station (write up how-to later)
3. Press 'Get bulbs from Q Station'
4. Set values of the lights as you wish
